# Remote-Sensing-of-Ladakh

Google earth engine is used to develop many dynamic, shareable apps for remote sensing data analyses. Using apps, one can use simple UI elements to quickly understand the Earth Engine's satellite data catalog and analyze it.
Ladakh is a region administered by India as a union territory, which constitutes a part of the larger Kashmir region and has been the subject of dispute.

This project will enable users to visualize and study satellite image data in the Ladakh region with simplicity without having to write any code themselves. 
They can use these apps to study satellite data pertaining to water, forest, atmosphere, and urban areas and find/overcome problems in that region.
This can be useful for predicting natural disasters or drastic changes in water temperatures or climate and comparing the data with previous years' data to study significant changes.

As of now we have only added the water and atmosphere apps in the landing page.
